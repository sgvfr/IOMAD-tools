#   A quick way to create restorable backups for an IOMAD moodle installation    #
#   There are probably 1000 better ways to do this, and my code skills are by    #
#   no means good, but it works for me and creates almost automated              #
#   Backups and restoral for my particular virtual host Apache installation      #
#   with several IOMAD installations running multiple versions and branches      #

 Quick Backup, update and disaster recovery restroral of IOMAD moodle installations.

 First things first.. I'm a firefighter, not a developer..
 edit the settings.cfg.default file.. I tried my best to be clear on what each does.

 rename to settings.cfg
 make the scripts executable (chmod +x) and simply run it eg.. ./backup-upgrade
 
 
 If you are going to try this, test this on a non-production system!
 I take no responsbility for my terrible code skills so use it at your own risk.


 Thanks!
